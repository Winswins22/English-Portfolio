    description: <> <Text>Before, I was unable to think about why anyone would buy the lottery, and thought that anyone who bought lottery tickets were dumb. I thought that since lotteries were very likely to cause you to lose money, there should be no case for anyone to but lottery tickets.</Text> <NewLine></NewLine> <Text> However, this changed when I saw some of my family memebers buy lottery tickets and when I watched some videos on the topic. I realized that in some cases, people would buy lottery tickets for the dream of winning big, even if the mathematics were aginst them. I found that people would buy lotteries tickets for the rush of gambling or the desperation to get out of a bad situation.</Text> <NewLine></NewLine> <Text>Although I am still against buying lottery tickets, I don't hate people who buy them as much now.</Text> </>
