    title: "I Am Greta",
    description: "It is important for people to stand up for what they believe in because action can get taken when people stand up for their beliefs. Throughout the film, Greta has to deal with unjustified scrutiny from politicians/reporters, scrutiny from the public (i.e. speeches, environmental decisions, etc.), and the weight from being the representative for the climate change movement. Greta is able to persevere day after day because of her family, support from the climate change movement, and her passion to reduce climate change. Greta’s resilience comes from support from the climate change movement, her knowledge of climate change, her passion for climate change, and her laser focus on climate change (in part because of Asperger’s). If I were in her position, I would get quickly exhausted from all of the public scrutiny and public speeches, and I am very impressed that Greta managed to carry the weight of being the leader of the climate change movement.",

    title: "Homeroom",
    description: "The film influenced my opinion on defunding the police as I had not been previously exposed to this topic. The movement for defunding the police calls for alternate and more specialized ways of responding to different situations, instead of using the police for most situations. For example, in schools, students are often arrested for minor issues like talking back to their teachers. One example of defunding the police in schools would be to replace the police with social workers to help improve the mental health of students, instead of using police and putting students under pressure due to the risk of being arrested. I think that police should be defunded, as not all situations are best handled with police.",

    title: "Kiss the Ground",
    description: "I sat outdoors in my backyard. The wind was a peaceful touch, and the rustling of the leaves put me at peace. The experience made me feel very peaceful. I was able to see a lot of plants, hear the leaves rustling, and felt the touch of the wind. I discovered that being outside in nature is very peaceful.",
