    description: "It is important for people to stand up for what they believe in because action can get taken when people stand up for their beliefs. Throughout the film, Greta has to deal with unjustified scrutiny from politicians/reporters, scrutiny from the public (i.e. speeches, environmental decisions, etc.), and the weight from being the representative for the climate change movement. Greta is able to persevere day after day because of her family, support from the climate change movement, and her passion to reduce climate change. Greta’s resilience comes from support from the climate change movement, her knowledge of climate change, her passion for climate change, and her laser focus on climate change (in part because of Asperger’s). If I were in her position, I would get quickly exhausted from all of the public scrutiny and public speeches, and I am very impressed that Greta managed to carry the weight of being the leader of the climate change movement.",
